## OPENPGPJS WRAPPER

* I don't think the API for openpgpjs is friendly so I want to wrap it in a new one. 
* Ideally this makes multi-party encrypt/decrypt simple for Apps.
* Still lots to figure out. Oh well
* New plan: project to test perf of js crypto libraries
  * Get a list of libs
  * Figure out suite of tests to do
